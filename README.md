XtendParserGeneratorComparison
==============================

Simple comparison of different parser generators that could be used to parse Xtend code

This comparison is based on the Xtend debug grammar that is
produced by Xtext. It does not contain any actions.
Antlr 3.2 was used as is, no tweaking. Antlr 4.2 was
tuned according to the suggestions from the Antlr4 book
and tree construction was disabled.

For results, see comments in PoorBenchmark.java.
